 * @brief Speech Definition (D50) metric for room impulse responses.
 *
 * The ::DefinitionCalculator class exposes a single static function,
 * ::DefinitionCalculator::calculate, which evaluates the **Definition**
 * (often denoted *D50*) of an impulse response.  Definition is the ratio of
 * the early arriving energy (within the first ~50 ms after the direct sound)
 * to the total energy, and is widely used as an intelligibility indicator.
 *
 * The exact integration window and scaling follow the implementation in
 * definition_calculator.cpp; no instance state is required.
